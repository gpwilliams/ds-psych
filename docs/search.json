    "text": "Welcome\nThis book is an introduction to Data Science for Psychologists (and others in the social sciences). Primarily using the R programming language, you will learn a general workflow that helps you to process, plot, analyse, and present data to your audience. It is expected that readers are familiar with introductory statistics typically taught at the Undergraduate level in Psychology programmes across the UK.\nThe first section of the book is written for those with no experience with R or programming in general. The focus here is on using R across the data processing and analysis pipeline so that you can automate data processing. This has the benefit of documenting your work, automating tedious manual processes, and avoiding user error. Along the way you will learn about best practices in terms of project structure and workflows, version control to track and manage updates to your code, and how to share your work online with the broader scientific community. By the end of this section you should be able to do all your data analysis work with R.\nThe second section of the book is written for those with a background in R who want to take advantage of the advanced data analysis methods available to this language. This section has a heavier focus on theory with the goal of understanding not just how to use advanced methods, but also how these methods work.\nThroughout, concepts will be taught using examples from real and simulated data from studies in Psychology. R will be taught using a tidyverse-first approach, using a suite of packages that are designed to make programming quick, easy, and highly readable.\nTo download the course content, including slides and exercise workbooks, please follow this link: https://github.com/gpwilliams/ds-psych_course"

If you have any important settings in here that you’ve defined personally, make a backup of these files in another location. Then, delete the originals. If you can’t find these files on your system, go to Finder, click on Home (i.e. the icon with the house), and type Shift + CMD + . to show the hidden files on your system. After completing the installation instructions you can go back to the new Makevars file in this location and add back in any settings you previously had.\nThere are two steps to configuring the C++ toolchain on Mac:\n\nInstalling the Xcode Command Line Tools\nInstalling gfortran.\n\nFirst, install the Xcode Command Line Tools by opening the terminal (use the spotlight search and type Terminal). In the terminal type the following and then press Enter:\nxcode-select —install.\nInstalling the Xcode Command Line Tools may take a while. Once done install gfortran. The version you install will differ whether you have a Mac with Apple or Intel chips.\n\nD.1.1.1 Macs with Apple Silicon (i.e. M1 or M2 chips)\nInstall the latest version of gfortran for your operating system at https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases. Check your macOS by clicking the Apple logo in the dock and selecting About this Mac. On the releases page, select the appropriate release for your operating system. At the time of writing for up to date Macs with Apple Silicon this is gfortran 12.2 for Ventura (macOS 13). Click gfortran-ARM-12.2-Ventura.dmg to download the software and install this on your system.\n\n\nD.1.1.2 Macs with Intel Silicon\nRegardless of your macOS version, install gfortran v8.2 (for Mojave) from https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases/tag/8.2\nClick the gfortran-8.2-Mojave.dmg file to download the executable. Open this and follow the instructions to install gfortran.\n\n\nD.1.1.3 Finishing Up (Apple and Intel Macs)\nFinally, we will configure the compiler to speed up compilation speed. Open RStudio and copy and paste the following into the R console.\n\ndotR <- file.path(Sys.getenv(\"HOME\"), \".R\")\nif (!file.exists(dotR)) dir.create(dotR)\nM <- file.path(dotR, \"Makevars\")\nif (!file.exists(M)) file.create(M)\ncat(\"\\nCXX14FLAGS += -O3 -mtune=native -arch x86_64 -ftemplate-depth-256\",\n    file = M, sep = \"\\n\", append = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nD.1.2 Installing RStan\nIn case you previously tried to install RStan and it didn’t work, copy and paste the following code into the RStudio console and press Enter. This will clean up R to remove any failed installations.\n\nremove.packages(\"rstan\")\nif (file.exists(\".RData\")) file.remove(\".RData\")\n\nRestart R by clicking Session, Restart R.\nCopy and paste the following code into the console and press Enter.\n\ninstall.packages(\"rstan\")\n\nFinally, we’ll check everything works by again copying and pasting the following code into the console and pressing Enter.\n\nexample(stan_model, package = \"rstan\", run.dontrun = TRUE)\n\nThis might take some time to run, but if you see a big wall of text and it ends by sampling a model then your install works.\n\n\n\nA working installation of RStan\n\n\nFinally, install brms by typing the following into the RStudio console:\n\ninstall.packages(\"brms\")\n\nYou’re now ready to work with Bayesian models in R!"

To do this, follow this link: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools42/rtools.html and download the Rtools42 installer. Click the executable and follow the instructions to install RTools.\nAs the current version of RStan on CRAN isn’t compatible with R 4.2, install the preview versions of StanHeaders and rstan by copying and pasting the following code into your RStudio console and pressing Enter:\n\ninstall.packages(\"StanHeaders\", repos = c(\"https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/\", getOption(\"repos\")))\ninstall.packages(\"rstan\", repos = c(\"https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/\", getOption(\"repos\")))\n\nEnsure that your installation works by running the following in the RStudio console:\n\nexample(stan_model, package = \"rstan\", run.dontrun = TRUE)\n\nIf this runs and samples (see the example above in the Mac instructions) then your RStan installation works.\nFinally, install brms by typing the following into the RStudio console:\n\ninstall.packages(\"brms\")\n\nYou’re now ready to work with Bayesian models in R!"
