# Installing Quarto

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a new open-source program for publishing technical documents. This allows you to create articles, presentations, websites, books, and various other outputs. Crucially, Quarto allows you to dynamically create content within these outputs using R, Python, Julia, or Observable. (In fact, this book was written in Quarto!)

We will use Quarto to create documents and to complete exercises for this course. On the [Quarto web page](https://quarto.org/), click Get Started.
